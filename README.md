# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

This is a repository for all of my assignments in QBS 181 in the Quantitative Biomedical Sciences Porgram at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.

I have been given permission to make my work public.

Note: All usernames, passwords, API tokens, etc., have been removed from the .R and .sql files.

The subdirectories are for each category of assignment:
* Exercises (8 total) - simple after-class assignments to check in on learning.
* Homeworks (3 total) - larger assignmnets that require greater levels of synthesis.
* Midterm (1 total) - assesment of full understanding of the course material up to the point of submission.
* Final (1 total) - Assesment of overall capabilities with the data wrangling techniques learned and employed in this class.

Each assignment can have one .R file and one .sql file, but there are no duplicate assignments or files of code within each subdirectory.
